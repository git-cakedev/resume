                                <h5><b>Autonomous Small-scale Sensor Cleaning ROV Prototype</b></h5> <small>Ocean Networks Canada, University of Victoria</small>
                                <p> In my Design and Communications class I worked in an interdisciplinary team of engineering students to create a robot prototype for Oceans Network Canada (OCN) for their VENUS and NEPTUNE observatories. The ROV was designed 
                                    to operate autonomously to drop a device in order to clean sensors on the ocean floor that experienced biofouling (the buildup of microorganisms and algae) from its harsh environment. 
                                    A series of dry lab tests were developed by UVic faculty to evaluate which group's ROV was most suitable to send to OCN as a proposal. I was in charge of programming the logic of the VEX Robotics board using the RobotC language.
                                    I learned alot about developing maintainable and encapsulated code since the design process was broken up into weekly SCRUMs and deliverables, starting with sketches from each team member, then locomotion of the robot, followed by infrared target acquisition, and finally dropping of the payload onto the target.
                                    A full breakdown of this project can be found at <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MQKA-dDSwoIdsW36yD99Kxj6QajZSXKn/view?usp=sharing">Autonomous Small-scale Sensor Cleaning ROV Prototype</a>.</p>

                                <p> I am very passionate about building personal computers for gaming, workstations, and servers. I have put together parts lists and hardware of over 10 systems, including a Ubuntu home server to host my files and videogame servers that tought me a lot about commandline tools and basic networking. Through PC building I have learned a lot about diagnosing any issues that arise from hardware or software malfunctions, and fixing those problems through my experience and online research.</p>
